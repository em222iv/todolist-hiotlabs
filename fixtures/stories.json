        "body": "<br><p>- What is really telling is that our customers see us as extremely knowledgeable. They trust our judgement and they trust our opinion and knowledge when it comes to PR and how to work with PR in the Mynewsdesk newsroom, Tina Lindahl, Mynewsdesk Nordic Head of Customer Retention, says and refers to the fresh customer survey she carried out in Sweden this spring.</p><p><b>Why a customer survey?</b><br>The purpose of the customer survey is to get an understanding of general behavior as well as future expectations of customers.</p><p>- We felt a need to get a better understanding of our customers, of the product usage, of the product experience and how the clients perceive us as a supplier, Tina explains. We\u2019ve interviewed around a hundred customers across all subscriptions and time spent with us. The reason why we chose Sweden to start with is that it\u2019s our biggest market.</p><p>In the video below, Tina Lindahl talks about how the survey was conducted, the opportunities we see for the future and the plans to follow up on the findings.</p><br><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/35GscMt8Kjc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Customers don\u2019t know what to expect from us</b><br>-The result of the survey identifies two big challenges that clients in general have, Maja Lindstr\u00f6m, Chief Product Officer at Mynewsdesk, says. The main challenge is to reach out: to get through the noise and to create something that reaches the intended audience. The other challenge is time.</p><p>She continues:<br>- The results also show that customers seem to find it difficult to define what Mynewsdesk is. When being asked \u201cWhat would you expect from a service like Mynewsdesk?\u201d, they don\u2019t really know what to say or expect. And they don\u2019t know what the alternatives are.</p><p>- That is a challenge, but it\u2019s also an opportunity. We can be much better in our messaging and how we talk about ourselves to define what kind of market we are in.</p><p><b>Next steps<br></b>- The new survey result confirms what we\u2019ve learned from other studies and customer interviews, and also corresponds well to what we\u2019ve put in our product roadmap, Maja declares, so we'll continue to execute on that. Another action that I would like to see happen is that our local teams in other markets also perform the survey, so that we can see if there are similarities or differences, and if the same challenges apply to all our customers.</p><p><b>The results<br></b>All Mynewsdesk employees may access the complete results of the survey on our shared Drive.

        "body": "<p>For little more than a year ago, Daniel Wilke, account manager at our Gothenburg office, was planning a trip to Africa to see the wildlife. At the same time, by what seems to be a lucky turn of fate, he met Lars and Ragnhild Jacobsson in an elevator. The couple turned out to run a non-profit organisation called <a href=\"http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/the-perfect-world-foundation\" target=\"_blank\">The Perfect World Foundation</a>, aimed to fight the poaching of endangered animals. The three of them quickly became friends and the couple helped Daniel to plan his African trip, while he in return helped them with advice on how to raise awareness of the poaching to the public.</p><p><b>An easy choice</b><br>- When Mynewsdesk announced that all staff had the opportunity to freely choose an organisation to work with for a year within our Social Innovation project, the choice was simple, Daniel says. I had just returned from Zambia where I was working as a volunteer to help lions, cheetahs and elephants and I had seen how serious the situation is for some animals. For example, Zambia only had 11 rhinos left! I was determined that I wanted to help and make a difference. That\u2019s why I offered The Perfect World Foundation a free newsroom along with my personal support for the coming year.</p><p><b>The need for buzz</b><br>To stop the poaching of rhinos, lions, elephants and other rare animals, the organisation have a huge need to raise money but also attention.</p><p>- In order to get that, we started to plan Sweden\u2019s first <a href=\"https://theperfectworldfoundation.org/what-we-do/projects/save-the-rhino/events/the-conservation-gala-dinner/\" target=\"_blank\">fundraising gala dinner</a> for animals, Daniel explains. With the help of some amazing people and their networks, Mynewsdesk as a PR-tool and generous sponsors, we managed to create \u201dbuzz\u201d around the gala. It helped us to fill the guest list with famous names of artists, performers, actors, politicians and even royalty.</p><p>Daniel and The Perfect World Foundation are now looking forward to the event that will take place the 18th of September at Hotel Post in Gothenburg.</p><p><b>The kind of help given to the organisation</b><br>Daniel\u2019s role is to manage the newsroom for the organisation. He writes press releases, contacts media and fills the newsroom with content. He is also responsible for the gala, to invite the media and present the celebrities to journalists. He has also helped to find and recruit some of the celebrity ambassadors and sponsors who has helped in various ways.</p><p>- Right now, I probably spend 8-10 hours per week in my spare- or lunchtime working with the gala preparations, he says. But normally, I put in one or two hours per week. Feeling very strongly about this cause, I feel it\u2019s worth every minute of my time. <br></p><p><i>About the photo: The cheetah in the picture is a rescued animal.&nbsp;</i></p><p>*Tweet this article with the hashtag #MNDimpact*</p>\n",

He knew what it\u2019s like to drive 45 minutes just to get a fresh tomato. In 2010, he set out to fix the problem. Outside his front door, that is.

And, of course then, approximately one week research trip to San Francisco later this year, or when appropriate.</p><b>When will we all go?</b><br><p>Naturally, this big project will take some time to manage. The provisional date for when will we go on the San Francisco trip all together is currently late 2015 or during 2016. We know that everybody are eager to know. Just stay tuned.

It keeps them up to date with the pace of technological development and helps them get the most out of high quality content, including images and videos, he adds.</p><p><b>How to help agencies provide value for their customers<br></b>The new programme ensures that agencies worldwide can take advantage of the latest brand newsroom and communications technology to make the most out of these shifts in digital communications.&nbsp;</p><p>- Agencies have always been wonderful at providing strategic advice for their clients as well as managing their content production, distribution and multichannel execution, Jonathan continues. In the video below, he explains why agencies, by providing their clients with the best possible technology in form of a Mynewsdesk newsroom, not only will help their customers to tell their stories in the most effective way but also why the Agency Partnership Programme will be one of our key growth drivers when we continue to develop. &nbsp;</p><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/oEcGleuzxoM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></p><p><b>The newsroom approach</b><br>- Agencies are struggling to keep up with the fast paced changing landscape and are employing personell from as many disciplines as possible in order to understand and offer 'expertise' in each field to their clients. Some talk about the newsroom approach and all are aware of the concept but are not able to offer it as a solution. This is where we come in, Nick Osborn, Agency and Partnerships Director at Mynewsdesk UK, says.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick continues:<br>- The beauty of working with agencies is that word spreads internally and you can end up getting many clients as a result of implementing a newsroom for just one of the brands they work with.</p><p><b>When everyone's a winner</b><br>See Jonathan Bean talk about the benefits for agencies when joining the programme, as well as what kind of results our agency partners have seen so far. Also, hear him explain why everyone in this partnership programme is a winner.&nbsp;</p><p><b><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/97gBMxZxPsc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></b></p><b><b>Top reasons why agencies may be interested in getting involved:</b></b><br><ul><li>The potential for increased turnover (one agency has increased their revenue by 30% through working with us)</li><li>Improved client relationships - our back office eases the content sign off process, is an effective collaboration tool and acts as a hub to store and distribute all of their client's content efficiently and effectively.</li><li>They can offer online newsroom technology without having to invest in building it themselves. There is also the potential for white labelling.</li><li>Our team of developers is constantly updating our technology to keep up with trends and improve the product.</li><li>We can customise our offering to meet their specific needs.</li><li>We have over 10 years experience in supporting agencies across the globe who look after some of the world's best brands including the likes of Google, Coca-Cola, Toshiba and McDonald's.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n",

        "body": "<p>Mynewsdesk and Stampen Sports Media, (one of Sweden\u2019s leading media houses), have initiated a partnership and recently launched the golf site <a href=\"http://www.golfing.se/\" target=\"_blank\">www.golfing.se</a>. The objective with the site is to be the starting place for all Swedish golf enthusiasts, and focus lies on international golf tournament coverage.</p><p>- In the start of the third quarter 2013 we wanted to play around with the ideas we had around how to create a new media form inspired by the likes of Flipboard and Zite, who are highly innovative in the news curation and mobile space, Peter Ingman, CEO at Mynewsdesk, explains. A couple of months later in our home market, Omni, a project originated by media group Schibsted was launched publicly, which gave us additional energy to continue our efforts with a similar concept. We also noticed a huge interest from various media houses regarding this. One of those was Stampen, our partner on the newly launched Golfing.se.</p><p><b>What is Mynewsdesk Labs?</b><br>Mynewsdesk exists at the intersection between communications, media and technology which are all industries undergoing considerable structural change. In order to understand and continue being a pioneer in these industries, we wanted to create an autonomous initiative to further learn about what opportunities existed when technology and media come together. Aligned with this, we came up with the idea Mynewsdesk Labs, managed by CPO Maja Lindstr\u00f6m.</p><p>- All individuals at Mynewsdesk are inspired to innovate at all times, but sometimes there's need to allocate time and resources to focus on a specific idea that has popped up somewhere in the organisation, Peter Ingman says. Mynewsdesk Labs is managed by Maja, but the resource allocation of people is done depending on the project at hand.</p><p><b>External partner to co-create the concept</b><br>- For this specific project we assigned an external partner, Putget Development, to co-create a new tool and concept together with us, Peter continues. Magnus Enderstein, the CEO, is a friend of mine and we met during his years at Aitellu, a Gothenburg based monitoring company. Magnus moved into our Stockholm office and he run a network of developers from Barcelona to Estonia with the relevant competence and speed necessary to complete this specific effort. In total, six people have been busy with this, including COO Jonathan Bean, and myself.</p><p><b>Platform for future development</b><br>As with all innovation within growing technology companies with multiple priorities, it is sometimes necessary to separate off efforts to ensure the core business continues growing strongly, which is happily the case with Mynewsdesk.</p>- The learnings from this initial project, the collaboration with a major media house and the resulting technology and experience gives us great new opportunities for future developments, Peter Ingman concludes. Mynewsdesk has always advocated that all companies have the opportunity to become media companies. Now we can match that thinking and words with a tangible project which gives us a platform to further develop and innovate at the intersection of communications, media and technology once again. &nbsp;<br>\n",

Not only for the chosen organisations, but also for our employees that will engage with a cause they feel passionate about during paid hours for a year.&nbsp;</p><p>- You may use two working days over this period to focus on the social innovation project, Gabriella explains. You're free to distribute the time in a way that best suits you and your organisation, but at least one contact per month with your organisation is mandatory to be able to see that they're using the platform, that they are on track and to collect any questions they have.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;Also, she says, keep notes of you organisation and the different stages you go through. They can be used later on for external and internal case studies to show how the project proceeded.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Getting started</b><br>Have you contacted your organisation yet? In the video below, Gabriella explains the first steps to take when your organisation has agreed to participate in the project.</p><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bqa63a5jtJY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></p><p>How to get started with your chosen organisation:</p><p><b>1. Get to know the organisation<br></b>Book a meeting or have a small chat with your&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;organisation for the first phase.</p><p>- Get to know the organisation and the person you will have contact with. What are their&nbsp;challenges?- What is happening in the organisation during this year?<br>- Who are their target groups?<br>- What do they want to tell or communicate?</p><p>This phase is a way for you to get to know the organisation. Remember that you don't need to have all the answers to their problems or questions. On your first meeting, listen to them and write these things down.</p><p>Need help presenting Mynewsdesk?&nbsp;Look at the attached document at the bottom of this article. And if it makes you feel more comfortable, ask a&nbsp;colleague&nbsp;within sales/support who are more familiar with the platform to join you in the first meeting.</p><p><b>2. Customer education<br></b>Every organisation have the right to get either physical education on the local offices or by telephone. Questions can also be asked to your country manager or your local support team.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Internal Education<br></b>This is still in the making but will be presented soon. All employees will get information and tips on how we can think and create a basic PR-plan for our organisations.&nbsp;</p>",

Nikolaj will leave the Danish organisation starting next week for six weeks together with our colleagues in Singapore.</p><p>- I hope to improve my understanding of international business and agencies in correlation with their brands, Nikolaj says. I\u2019m for sure looking forward to this great experience and will do my best to reach my targets and support the Asian team.</p><p>- I\u2019m also looking forward to become inspired by the city-scape and \"big-business\" potential down there, he adds.</p><p><b>Secondment assignments</b><br>In Singapore, Nikolaj will:</p><p>1. Conduct a review of our current client base and ensure they are using Mynewsdesk in the best possible way.</p><p>2. Conduct 30 meetings with both existing and new agencies/resellers in Singapore and the region to develop our agency partner and value added resellers program.</p><p>3. Coach the existing Mynewsdesk Asia team in the best Mynewsdesk sales techniques.</p><p><b>Success by enthusiasm</b><br>The Dane has got some experience of the Asian culture through his interest in a variety of martial arts, ranging from the Japanese aspects of Budo, the Chinese variety of Kung-fu and the Filipino martial arts of stick and knife fighting, (skills he hopefully doesn\u2019t need to practice during the secondment), but has no previous experience of doing business in the region.</p><p>- I go with energy and spirit, Nikolaj says. To me it means I have no predetermined boundaries which can block my vision. Businesslike, I think the Danish market is relatively comparable to the Asian markets since we are facing some of the or similar challenges as they are, for example with the stand-alone brand newsroom approach where the client adds their own contacts.</p>- Nikolaj\u2019s boundless enthusiasm will make sure this will be a real success for both Mynewsdesk Asia and also for his personal development, Jonathan Bean, Chief Operating Officer at Mynewsdesk, states.<br>\n",

We know that the people we\u2019re looking for are engaged and active on LinkedIn, maybe not for job search directly but if they would see a really interesting vacancy popping up on their profile, I'm sure they would click it.</p>- In Germany, most job searchers use Xing, Anica Herrmann, People Officer at Mynewsdesk in Germany, explains. Xing is a similar platform to LinkedIn, and we will have a company profile on Xing up and running during the next weeks that we will use in a similar way for the German market.<p></p><p><b>Attracting true stars</b><br>In today's video, Ulrika Karlsson talks about what types of talents Mynewsdesk are looking for and also gives her advice to those who are interested in joining the Mynewsdesk crew.&nbsp;</p><p>Share the video with those you think would be a perfect match for the Mynewsdesk workplace!</p><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UruGiVnRXDM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p><b>We need your help to find true talents</b><br>- There is actually a lot all Mynewsdeskers could do to actually help us find true talents, Ulrika points out. Learn how in the list below.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Be an ambassador for the Mynewsdesk workplace by updating your LinkedIn or Xing profile. When talents are looking for a job they want to be somewhere where there are other talents, so please make sure you display the workplace on the platform you use. In this way, people who are looking at your profiles will also see a link to our career page. </p><p>For Xing, it's important that all employees use the right company name in their Xing profiles, which is Mynewsdesk GmbH. When you click on the link behind Mynewsdesk GmbH, you will get to the Xing company profile automatically. <br></p></li><li><p>Another thing you can do is of course to share our <a href=\"http://people.mynewsdesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">vacancies</a> through social media, or even spread the word in your networks and among family and friends. </p></li><li><p>Remember that everyone is a headhunter, not only our employees but externals as well! We have something we call the Finders Fee. It means that if you recommend someone to apply for a position at Mynewsdesk and we hire that person, you\u2019ll actually be rewarded with Euro 1.000 for most vacancies like sales persons or others (when they've passed probation). And even better, if you find a developer you'll get a double finders fee (Euro 2.000) because developers are really difficult to find. Send an email to <a href=\"mailto:youwilllovethisone@mynewsdesk.com\">youwilllovethisone@mynewsdesk.com</a>&nbsp;and we'll look that person up.&nbsp;</p></li></ol>",

        "body": "<p>- We are coming from the PR side, but a lot of changes have taken place in our industry, says Peter Ingman, CEO of Mynewsdesk. New buzzwords arose in 2013 and we clearly moved the needle within thought leadership as we actively participated talking about the Brand Newsroom.</p><p>- We also know that our competitors are shifting towards content marketing, which is an immensely bigger market than PR (40 billion dollar compared to 2.2 billion dollar). When marketeers are allocating their budgets for the new year, we will probably see how advertisement numbers are decreased in favor of content marketing but also investments by brands to have their own content hub.</p><p>- Mynewsdesk as a company is perfectly positioned for this development, Peter says. We have great knowledge of PR and media relations, but as we are part of a big media house, we're now betting on brand journalism to help our clients produce relevant and engaging content. </p><p><b>The question Why</b><br>- The questions we have been most preoccupied with during the past months have been what we are and where we are going, he continues. Today, most of us talk about our PR platform, but room for service offerings could be widened. Lately, the General Management Team have been discussing this. We've been asking ourselves why we are in business and how we do business. </p><p>- We believe that true enthusiasm for a brand can only be earned and never bought, Peter explains. We are here to help organisations reach out to and earn that respect from those that matter most to them.</p><p>- We also define the way how we do business as that our products and our people always aim to bring simplicity to the daily work of communication professionals. We help them create genuine engagement with their audience so they might succeed far beyond their own expectations. And as the world around us change, we always challenge ourselves to come up with better solutions.</p><p><b>We protect our core while we develop the future<br></b>- Our efforts are now focused even more on understanding and delivering services that cater for the future, Peter Ingman says. In this intriguing industry, one of the two things we need to do is protect the core, as in keeping the love of our customers. We will build upon our strengths and keep improving the product. Examples of these efforts are our new Analyze tool and our Customer Success Initiative, and we will allocate more resources here.</p><p>- We will also develop the future, as we have always done, he continues. We as a company always strive to lead market changes instead of just adapt to them. Our business strategy requires us to be agile, dare to try out new functions and be able to turn very quickly. We will continue to surprise the market with new ways of doing things.</p><p><b>The Focus areas for 2014 (read where we re-invest all the money) are:</b></p><ol><li><p>Customer Success has always been at our core, but even more so we have positioned this specifically for reaching even higher levels.</p></li><li><p>Product Development means adding resources, improve and build for the future, integrate current and grow more fun lab initiatives. The Content Creation module is one of them.</p></li><li><p>Marketing Sales Funnel. To get real value from our efforts to see the whole process through.</p></li><li><p>Reseller program. Finland gave us great insights in how to become successful with a trusted partner. We have no plans to grow with new offices this year, however optimize our customer acquisition through a well supported reseller program. The advantage would be that it gives us more effective scalability but with a lower risk. This is the reason why Peter is going to Brazil within two weeks.</p></li></ol><p><b>Our main targets are:</b></p><p>1) Employee Satisfaction. We strive to stay on a 90 % level in the employee satisfaction survey. We will further develop our creative and fun workplace with inspiring colleagues and a meaningful purpose. Our Social Innovation Project is a good example and it's a great possibility to really do some good for others. We have already received a lot of positive feedback both internally and from our stakeholders. The Social Innovation Project also builds reputation and respect in the market, as well as develops ourselves to become broader and even more skilled in modern comms practice.</p><p>2) Loyal customers. We aim to maintain the level of keeping 9 out of 10 customers. </p><p>3) Growth. We are proud for our sound business model and our ability to be profitable and still grow. But most of our competitors have the luxury with a lot of cash to invest for quicker expansion. Our owners NHST have therefore approved an investment budget in order to provide a strong vehicle for strong long term growth over the coming years.</p>\n",

That\u2019s why we flew down the entire developer team from the Stockholm office for an open Dev Corner in Berlin last week, says Teo Ljungberg, Developer at Mynewsdesk in Stockholm. A Dev Corner is our internal team-conference where we share ideas and new technologys, he adds.</p><p>Another reason for the Berlin event was to form a network of skilled developers, as Mynewsdesk is looking at setting up a development team also in Berlin.</p><p><b>Meet &amp; Greet At The Mynewsdesk Berlin Office<br></b>With some help of free beer and pizza, the Dev Corner attracted about 25 German developers that managed to arrive at the Mynewsdesk Berlin-Kreutzberg office despite of an unexpected snowstorm.</p><p>- During the event, we mingled and listened to a few presentations, Teo says. The participants gave us great feedback on how much fun they had and how cool it was to fly down the entire team to Berlin for a meetup. There are quite a few startups in Berlin, like Soundcloud and 6 Wunderkinder, which program in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but the developer communities in Berlin are small and dense and that\u2019s why we\u2019re pondering on starting our own developers community in Berlin, as we have in Stockholm.</p><p><b>Knowledge Sharing At Work<br></b>Being the largest Ruby team in Sweden, there\u2019s a huge learning potential for the Mynewsdesk developers while being at work.</p><p>- Pair programming is the way we go, Teo Ljungberg explains. Two brains are always smarter than one and as you need to explain your ideas and describe the problem, there\u2019s an extremely favorable learning environment to be around. And personally, Teo adds, I enjoy working together with someone rather than sitting alone.</p><p>The job situation at Mynewsdesk is also appealing.<br>- Being a product centric company, we never just receive an order to do something but are always asked what we think, Teo explains. That\u2019s why we call ourselves developers rather than programmers.</p><p>He continues:<br>- We\u2019re always free to try out new things, and two days per month we have lab days where we can work on anything we like.</p><p>Wanna see for yourself what happens at a Dev Corner?

We knew that changes would take place due to the ownership model, but it happened earlier than anticipated. That means that we have developed a new management structure. We now have all key positions in place, as well as a dedicated General Management Team, and that made it possible for us to continue our international expansion.</p><p>- We succeeded last year in continued growth whilst being profitable, due to loyal customers, successfully delivered record sales numbers and we also reached an ambitious budget, Peter explains.&nbsp;Mynewsdesk has 4,000 customers and manage over 5,000 newsrooms. The customers are very loyal and 9 of 10 stay with the company.<br></p>\n",

The same number last year was 86 percent and our target for 2013 was 89 percent.&nbsp;<b><br></b></p><p>Looking at the individual markets, there's an even higher result in the UK. 95 percent of the employees agree on that Mynewsdesk is a great place to work. (Read more about what Peter Britton, manager of the UK team, thinks of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mynewsdesk.com/people/blog_posts/manager-success-5-tips-on-how-to-create-a-happy-work-experience-22297\" target=\"_blank\">happy work experiences</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mynewsdesk.com/people/blog_posts/peter-britten-s-top-5-advice-on-how-to-motivate-employees-21983\" target=\"_blank\">team motivation</a> by clicking the links).&nbsp;</p><p>We are not yet among the top ten employers in the study, but we are for sure closing in as we are just 5-10 percentage points below the top results.&nbsp;</p><p>These are the top 3 results for Mynewsdesk in the survey:</p><ul><li>I can be myself around here. (95% agree)</li><li>People care about each other. (93% agree)</li><li>My immediate manager recognizes honest mistakes as part as doing business. (92% agree)</li></ul><b>The GMT Promise</b><p></p><p>There are only two questions that have a result where most of the employees agree that this is not completely true. These are the lowest results in the survey:</p><ul><li>The management team has a clear view of where the organization is going and how to get there. (40% agree)</li><li>I feel I receive a fair share of the profits made by this organization. (48% agree)</li></ul>- We're not surprised that people are questioning the ability of management to present a clear view of the direction of the company, says <b>Peter Ingman, CEO of Mynewsdesk</b>. The truth is that we don't always have a ready-made map that tells us where we're going. The industry is constantly changing and as we always strive to lead that change instead of just adapt to it, our strategy is more about discovering instead of setting up a long-term plan and stick to it no matter what. Our business strategy requires us to be agile, dare to try out new functions and be able to turn very quickly. But we should have been better at communicating just that. <br><br>-It's clear that the general management team has a communication lesson to learn, Peter continues. The promise from the GMT for the new year is to become much better in communicating the company's turns and also how we invest our profit. The All Employee Meeting earlier this week was part of that effort, and even more focus will be put on explaining the operations in the future.&nbsp;<b></b>",

People raged against it and the action has been called all kinds of stuff. \"Selfie-gate\", \"selfish\" and \"the world's worst selfie\" are just some of it.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing is clear: the picture taken by the three world leaders is as interesting as the phenomena itself. \"Selfie\" is the word of the year according to the Oxford Dictionaries, and taking photos of oneself (and uploading them on social media) engages people of all ages, sexes and cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, many people are uncomfortable in front of the camera, especially when it comes to corporate video and photo shoots.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://people.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/selfie-combo_m.jpg\"><img src=\"http://people.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/selfie-combo_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"selfie-combo_m\" width=\"446\" height=\"620\"></a></p><p>Last week, <b>Frida \u00d6jstrand</b>, intern at the Mynewsdesk London office, visited Stockholm to video record the crew for her Mynewsdesk employee movie.

If you\u2019re able to make them forget about the camera, your clip will look more natural and relaxed.</li><li>Ask the person you are going to interview to put on clothes they\u2019re comfortable with. If the person doesn\u2019t feel at ease with their appearance, it\u2019ll show in the video.</li><li>Change environment! Find another place than in the middle of the office space. It\u2019s great to go to a cafe and tape the interview over a cup of coffee.</li><li>Appear calm and happy when you\u2019re doing the interview.

Hilla managed the Twitter account during the day, and her \nmain responsibilities was to cover the talks, and monitor and reply to \naudience reactions and questions.</p>\n<p><strong>#mnday was trending on Twitter as the second most popular hashtag. What\u2019s your reaction to that?</strong><br>\n- I think it\u2019s amazing, though not surprising. There were loads of \npeople tweeting, and you could really tell that the message from the \ntalks resonated with the audience.</p>\n<p><strong>Which one of the lecturers got the most reactions?</strong><br>\n- I would probably say it was a tie between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RenataChlumska\">Renata Chlumska</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catarinaclowe\">Catarina Cl\u00f6we</a>.\n Everyone were so energized, impressed and enthused by Renata\u2019s talk, \nher energy really took hold. Then Catarina came on, and the tweeters \njust fell completely for her honesty and courage. They both had great \nstage presence and their talks resonated with people.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the most challenging about tweeting live at the Mynewsday event?</strong><br>\n- I\u2019m not an avid tweeter, the whole experience of tweeting from an \nevent was new to me, so just trying to listen to all the interesting \ntalks, and at the same time tweet something intelligent was quite a \nchallenge.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the most memorable thing that happened during the Twitter session?</strong><br>\n- I was really impressed with the quality of the tweets from the \naudience. It\u2019s so hard to live tweet, and yet so many people managed to \ncapture perfectly a phrase or a point. There were so many clever, \narticulate people in the audience. I just wanted to retweet what they \nsaid!</p>\n<p>Photo credits: <a href=\"http://www.hilladuka.se\" target=\"_blank\">hilladuka.se</a></p><br>\n",
