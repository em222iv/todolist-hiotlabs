# Task: Story Dashboard #

We at Mynewsdesk have a page where we display the [latest news](http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/stories) from our customers.

To see your way of making a web application, we have prepared this assignment for you that we call "The Story Dashboard".

The idea with the Story Dashboard is that it will render the latest news from our service. It will be displayed on a screen in fullscreen mode (Could be on Mobile or up to 50" a monitor) and automatically present news items without the user have to do any interaction for switching team.

Your task is to implement the Story Dashboard after your own ideas and tools but with the requirements and requests we listed below in mind.

## Requirements ##
* Responsive design, mobile first
* JavaScript/CoffeeScript
* Semantic HTML
* Work in the latest official browser releases (Yes, you can use the cool features that you dream about in your projects)

## Request ##
* Simulate a news item ticker using the news feed. Display one news item at a time.
* The news item should be displayed with the following information: image, header, summary, date
* Make it look good :)
* Impress us with some extra feature!

## Data source ##
In the repository you will find a JSON-file [fixtures/stories.js](fixtures/stories.js) with a repsonse from our service with a sample of news. Either use the fixture or data from our Partner Channel API.

If you want to use our Partner Channel API to fetch frequency updated information you can use [Channel 607](http://www.mynewsdesk.com/partner/api/1_0/LY6eZJ5rZDqDuzBQWBHbVA/channel/607/material/list).

[Documentation Partner Channel API](http://www.mynewsdesk.com/docs/partner_kanaler_1_0)

## Setup ##
It should be easy for us to setup and test the application so the readme should contain information on how to setup the application to run it locally.

## Goal ##
We want to see your knowledge in frontend development, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and how you tackle design, user interaction and user experience together with technology. You decide what you want to focus on and prepare yourself to present your solution for us and describe about the chooses you made, with libraries, tools, testing and so on.

## Time ##
It's totally up to you how much time you will spend on the application, but we usually say about 4-8 hours. When you're ready with the assignment please send us an email to take a look into the application and give us a hint of how much time you spent.

_Do not hesitate to contact us with questions if something should be unclear._
